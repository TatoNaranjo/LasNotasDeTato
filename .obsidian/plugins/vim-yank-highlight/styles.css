        There is a stupid gap between the lines which is not covered by the background-color and it looks ugly
        since line contents are inline elements their height is [pretty arbitrary](https://iamvdo.me/en/blog/css-font-metrics-line-height-and-vertical-align) and depend on
        on font properties and not line-height or font-size.

        There is something called [line gap override](https://web.dev/articles/css-size-adjust#line-gap-override) which
        can close the gap for the background highlighting, but I can't figure out how to apply it.

        The best solution so far is to approximately [pad the highlight span](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56781592) to overlap the gap.

        This works mostly well, but is finicky and might not work for all fonts and not the best for semi-transparent highlights;
        also, the bottom line of the selection jumps a little on highlight, but it's mostly unnoticeable.

        Another solution would be to grab the actual span element that is not wrapped,
        get it's calculated height and calculate the exact padding values, but it requires
        accessing DOM elements and CodeMirror doesn't let you get to the actual HTML elements
        and I don't want to query them manually as it's messy and should be done for every range.
