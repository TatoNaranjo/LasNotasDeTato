Script about my life for [[Lengua Extranjera IV]] subject.

Hello and welcome everyone! I'm Santiago Naranjo, most known as Tato, and today i'm here to tell you about my life, and more specifically about my aspirations and dreams in this last year.

For the people that don't know me, let me introduce myself. I'm Santiago Naranjo Herrera, a 6th semester Systems Engineering Student and Competitive Programmer for the University of Cundinamarca. I'm a person with a lot of aspirations, more specifically, mental aspirations. I always say that I have no regrets about the things I have done or thought throughout my life, because those are the very things that have shaped my way of living my life. However, I think that, if I had to regret anything, it would have been not having learned to organize my time better.

You see, throughout my college career I've met several people who have been plagued by the lack of time they have to do different tasks or learn different things over the years; it should be noted that once upon a time, a few years ago, I was that kind of person too.

Listening to this, you would think that I had to go through some incident that marked my life so that I could learn to organize my time, but I would tell you that you are not right. One vacation morning I woke up with the curious question: What if I organized my time more, and suddenly I set myself the goal of planning everything I would do in the remaining April month.

If i had to suggest you some powerful applications to organize your university life, i would say that you only need three of them.

The first one that i'm going to mention is *Notion*. This is a project manager app that helps you to make your own study planner. When i was starting to organize my life, i was afraid of using an app that in the beginning gives you only a blank project and literally tells you: "Organize me however you want". However, once you seek how to add templates, working is much easier. If you don't want to waste your time designing new web-page components or just want to have a pre-made planner for your daily tasks, you must check the Notion's Templates web-page, where a lot of designs await for you.

The second one is an app called *Obsidian*. This is like the renewed version of the text editor for any of your Operative Systems. The magic behind this powerful tool resides in having your own Wikipedia written in Markdown Language, and the fact that you can customize absolutely everything in your workspace with the integrated plugins. You'll have to figure yourself how to sync your notes with some cloud service, because the proper Obsidian functionality is paid. (I'm not going to tell you which to use), but if you find how to make it, you'll have your own information in such many devices as you want.

The third and last is one that all of you know, the ultimate productivity tool, The savior for procrastinators, The peanut butter of the productivity bread, the Dark Souls of the time hacks. Guys... i present you The Timer App. 

You might be thinking that i'm crazy, but with a organizer method as Pomodoro, it gets very useful. When i'm studying, i use to set 25 minutes to do my tasks without looking my cellphone, and set 5 minutes to take a rest. This is a method that works for a lot of people, so if you haven't used it, i recommend it to focus in the important things of your day.

One of the most important things to organize your life is your behavior and engagement with the time of the day. If you don't have some will of being productive, this methods that i give you won't work. Sometimes, we think that the day doesn't fit to all of our tasks, but in some cases, we don't notice about how much time we are missing. So... these are some of my tips. I hope they help you. 

When I told you that I was going to tell you about my aspirations and dreams, I did it because organizing my life in a better way was one of them. I am a person who is always saying that I need to improve every day, but I realized that if you don't make things happen and just keep saying that you want to be better, you won't achieve any of your goals.

I want that this tools and story be a lesson about how the ideas can reach your mind in random spaces of your life. It could be when you're not expecting them, but i'm really sure that if you just grab this idea and don't let it go, you'll make a lot of beautiful things in your life.

And that's all for today guys, I hope you liked it. Without anything else to say, I'm tato, and I'll see you next time.
