# ¿Which is Malta's Official Language?

The official languages of Malta's country are Maltese and English.

Even though Maltese is the national language of malta, their people used to speak in English with fluency, so... for that reason and another historical fact, if you speak in English and you want to go to Malta, you don't have to learn Maltese necessarily.

But, if you want to learn how to speak Maltese, many schools teach courses to non-native speakers.

Malta is located in the center of the Mediterranean Sea, so, most of the typical dishes surround the seafood. All of the foreign countries that ruled Malta brought something new to the country.

# ¿What's the typical music of Malta?

Malta's traditional music is Għana. 

Għana has two types of meanings. In this genre, the people sing about wealth and richness. Also, Ghana is associated with Kantilena, a type of singing with a slow rhythm. A singer of this genre is locally called "Ghannej" (Literally meaning 'The Singer').

Now, let's talk about Kantilena. Kantilena is the oldest known literary text in the Maltese Language.

Approximate traduction in English of the poem is:

```
Witness my predicament, my friends (neighbours), as I shall relate it to you:  
[What] never has there been, neither in the past, nor in your lifetime,  
A [similar] heart, ungoverned, without lord or king (sultan),  
That threw me down a well, with broken stairs  
Where, yearning to drown, I descend the steps of my downfall,  
I climb back up and down again, always faced with high seas.  
  
It (she) fell, my building, its foundations collapsed;  
It was not the builders’ fault, but the rock gave way,  
Where I had hoped to find rock, I found loose clay  
It (she) fell, my edifice, (that) which I had been building for so long.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il-Kantilena#cite_note-4)  
  
And so, my edifice subsided, and I shall have to build it up again,  
You change it to the site that suits her/it  
Who changes his place, changes his fate!  
for each (piece of land) has its own shape (features);  
there is white land and there is black land, and red  
But above all, (what) you want from it is a fruit.
```
