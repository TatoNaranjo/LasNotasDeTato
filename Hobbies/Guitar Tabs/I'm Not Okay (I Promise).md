[Intro] D  Bm  Em  A

[Primera Parte]

D
Well if you wanted honesty that's all you had to say

Bm                                                                                                    
I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way
Em
For all the dirty looks

The photographs your boyfriend took
         A
Remember when you broke your foot for jumping out the second floor?

[Coro]

        D
I'm not okay
        Bm
I"m not okay
        Em
I'm not okay
            A
You wear me out

[Segunda Parte]

D
What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems? (I'm

not okay!)
Bm                                                                                                                             
I told you time and time again you sing the words, but don't know

what it means
Em
To be a joke and look

Another line without a hook
     A
I held you close as we both shook

For the last time

Take a good hard look

[Coro]

        D
I'm not okay
        Bm
I"m not okay
        Em
I'm not okay
            A
You wear me out

( D  Bm  Em  A )

[Tercera Parte]

Em
Forget about the dirty looks

The photographs your boyfriend took
     A
You said you read me like a book, but the pages all are torn and

Frayed
D
I'm okay
     Bm
I'm okay
         Em
I'm okay now (I'm okay now)

But you need to listen to me
A
Because I'm telling you the truth

I'm mean this

I'm okay! (Trust me)

[Coro]

     D
I'm not okay
         Bm
I'm not okay

But I'm not okay, I'm not o-fucking-kay
          Em
I'm not okay
          A      D
I'm not okay (eeee)
