[Intro]

C  F7M/C  C  F7M/C

[Primera Parte]

  C             C9/B         Am
Slip inside the eye of your mind
            E             F7M/C  G
Don't you know you might find
                    C  Am  G
A better place to play

 C             C9/B       Am  
You said that you'd never been
              E                 F7M/C  
But all the things that you've seen
G                   C  Am  G
  Will slowly fade away

[Pre-Coro]

F                   Fm          C
  So I start a revolution from my bed
            F
'Cause you said the brains 
   Fm             C
I had went to my head
  F                Fm               C
Step outside, the summertime's in bloom
  G   
Stand up beside the fireplace
 E/G#
Take that look from off your face
 Am             G          F7M/C   G
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

[Coro]

     C  C9/B      Am
And so Sally can wait
      E             F7M/C
She knows it's too late
          G          C  Am  G
As we're walking on by
     C     C9/B   Am  E
Her soul slides away
                F7M/C         G
But don't look back in anger!
             C  
I heard you say

( C9/B  Am  E  F7M/C  G  C  Am  G )

[Segunda Parte]

 C               C9/B           Am
Take me to the place where you go
       E       F7M/C  G 
Where nobody knows
                  C  Am  G
If it's night or day

  C                     C9/B
Please, don't put your life 
        Am
In the hands
      E           F7M/C  G
Of a rock'n'roll band
                      C  Am  G
Who'll throw it all away

[Pre-Coro]

F                        Fm
  I'm gonna start a revolution 
      C
From my bed
            F
'Cause you said the brains 
   Fm          C
I had went to my head
  F               Fm               C
Step outside the summertime's in bloom
  G   
Stand up beside the fireplace
 E/G#
Take that look from off your face
        Am             G
'Cause you ain't ever gonna 
      F7M/C   G
Burn my heart out

[Coro]

     C  C9/B      Am
And so Sally can wait
      E             F7M/C
She knows it's too late
          G          C  Am  G
As we're walking on by
     C     C9/B   Am  E
Her soul slides away
                F7M/C         G
But don't look back in anger!
             C  Am  G
I heard you say

[Último Coro]

     C  C9/B      Am
And so Sally can wait
      E             F7M/C
She knows it's too late
          G          C  Am  G
As we're walking on by
     C     C9/B   Am  E
Her soul slides away
                F7M/C         G
But don't look back in anger!
             C  Am  G
I heard you say

     C  C9/B      Am
And so Sally can wait
      E             F7M/C
She knows it's too late
          G          C  Am  G
As we're walking on by
     C     C9/B   Am
Her soul slides away
                F
But don't look back in anger!
            Fm
Don't look back in anger!
             C  G  Am  E  F
I heard you say
Fm                 C
   At least not today
