Tips that i get when i'm playing or studying [[Chess]]

- When the king is on the horizontal middle of the board, the most dangerous piece for him is the piece with the most freedom of movement (First goes The Queen, then, the Knight).
- At the moment of connecting the rooks, the last piece that i must move is the queen.
